Performing analysis on kickstarters data to uncover trends

As Louise is interested in theater campaigns in the United States and Great Britain. My findings are that the most successful campaigns start in May in the United States. In Great Britain there are 604 succssful campaigns but you will need to lower your goal amount. I've included pivot tables of parent categories that performed successfully and failed.
